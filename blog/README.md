## Why Manage a Blog Through Git?
I use git to blog for multiple reasons:

* __Revision History:__ People can see all the changes I do to my posts. This
  is a must if an article is to be reffered.
* __Offline Access:__ Everybody can keep and offline asynchronous version of the
  entire blog.
* __Git Features:__ When writing the articles I have all Git features accessible,
  that makes maintenance a breeze.
